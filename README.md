             ðŸ‘Œ Simple Marketplace (Django)
âœŒ This is a beginner-friendly marketplace project built using Django as part of my learning journey. The project includes:

  âœ”  A basic user authentication system (sign-up, login, logout).
  âœ”  Features to list items with images, names, and prices.
  âœ”  A responsive design for easy navigation.
  âœ”  Clean and organized code to practice Django fundamentals.

ðŸ˜Ž This project is a practice exercise to improve my skills in Django development, focusing on creating dynamic web applications.
